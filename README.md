# SoccerCounter

Goals of this app: To keep score of a soccer match as well as the count of yellow and red cards that each team receives. The values can be incremented by one, when a goal is scored, or when a team gets a card. The option of decrementing a value by one is provided in order to correct misclick errors. The reset button resets all the values to zero. The app is intended to keep track of values and display them when the screen orientation is changed. I have tried to make full use of the colors.xml, strings.xml and various other resources folders.
